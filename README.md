 Notes about some of the sound design:
 - Most sound was placed within the beta "House" scene,
      - 3D looping sound effect (News_Reporter_Low) attached to a png of my "Spokes Person".
      - 3D proximity sound effect (Chimes) that plays when the player gets close to the top left corner of the room.
      - 2D looping ambient sound effect (BackgroundSFX) that plays throughout the scene.
 - There are now Audio Reverb Areas in most scenes. Most use the default "Room" but there is also "city" reverb.
